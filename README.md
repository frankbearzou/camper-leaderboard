# Camper Leaderboard
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## User Stories
- I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
